More chart types must be supported.

Interface to convert iterable data types into charts (e.g., dictionary into pie
chart).

Caching? Django's built in caching should do well but it hasn't been tested yet.

Template tag support so that we can do something like this:

    {% load matplotlib %}
    {% pie x=mylist colors="r,g,b" labeldistance=0.5 as pie_url %}
    <img src="{{ pie_url }}" atl="my cherry pie chart" />

Error handling in not very graceful. Incorrect url params may cause server errors.

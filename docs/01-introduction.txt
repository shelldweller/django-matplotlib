Generating matplotlib images from django
========================================

Basically there are two ways to do it:

1. Generate an image in your view, save it to the media directory, construct its
URL and pass it to template for rendering.

2. Output image directly from a django view.

At the moment this project primarily concentrates on the latter.


Example of URL based access
===========================

Using this project one can easily generate images by entering query parameters
in your faviourite browser's address bar. E.g. an address like this one will
output a three colour pie chart in PNG format:

    http://example.com/path-to-matplotlib-url/pie.png?x=1,2,3

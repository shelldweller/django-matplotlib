Label truncation
================

Long labels may be truncated which seems to be a common problem with
automatic layout in matplotlib. A couple of things to address this:

1. Decrease "font.size" in your MATPLOTLIB_RC_PARAMS (or resource file)

2. Use new lines (URL escaped as `%0A`) instead of spaces in your labels. When
generating labels automatically I find it quite handy to split long labels into
multiple lines with python's built-in `textwrap` module.

3. Increase image size.

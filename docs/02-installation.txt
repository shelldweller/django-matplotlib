INSTALLATION
============

1. Put django_matplotlib on your Pyhton path

2. Hook django_matplotlib to your URL configuration, e.g.:

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^mpl/', include('django_matplotlib.urls')),
        # ... more URLs here
    )
    
If you have a special handler for common image extentions, such as .png, the
default django_matplotlib URLs may not work for you. If this is the case you'll
have to create your own definitions for URLs.

3. Configure matplotlib settings (optional).

django_matplotlib does not have models so it in not necessary to add it to your
list of INSTALLED_APPS and hence you don't need to run syncdb.
